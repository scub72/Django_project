Philosophy

    A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. 
    It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing. 
    Django follows the DRY Principle. 
    
    The goal is to define your data model in one place and automatically derive things from it.
   
    This includes the migrations - unlike in Ruby On Rails, for example, migrations are entirely 
    derived from your models file, and are essentially a history that Django can roll through to 
    update your database schema to match your current models.
